                                expressions from data. The algorithm uses an

                                automatically partition a time-series datum into
                                piecewise linear chunks, a bucketing strategy over

                                We extend our CAV 2015 paper with a different algorithm for computing Skorokhod 
                                distance. The key assumption for this algorithm is that traces are now sampled
                                at a greater frequency, allowing a simpler piecewise-constant interpolation scheme
                                to be used to interpret traces. The paper studies the tradeoff between the sampling
                                frequency and the computational efficiency of the new algorithm. The paper also
                                extends transference results to TPTL that allows freeze quantifiers in the value

                                We clarify certain notions: for STL formulas with an unbounded time
                                horizon, we introduce the notion of nominal robustness. The key
                                technical result in this paper is that for arbitrary STL formulas, 
                                the nominal quantitative robustness can be monitored using number 
                                of variables that is exponential in the length of the formula, but
                                independent of the length of the trace being monitored.

                                 Designers of industrial embedded control systems, such as automotive,
                                 aerospace, and medical-device control systems, use verification and
                                 testing activities to increase their confidence that performance
                                 requirements and safety standards are met. Since testing and
                                 verification tasks account for a significant portion of the
                                 development effort, increasing the efficiency of testing and
                                 verification will have a significant impact on the total development
                                 cost. Existing and emerging simulation-based approaches offer improved
                                 means of testing and, in some cases, verifying the correctness of
                                 control system designs.

                        Modern cyber-physical systems (CPS) are often developed in a model-based development (MBD)
                        paradigm. The MBD paradigm involves the construction of different kinds of models: (1) a plant model that
                        encapsulates the physical components of the system (e.g., mechanical, electrical, chemical components) using
                        representations based on differential and algebraic equations, (2) a controller model that encapsulates the embedded
                        software components of the system, and (3) an environment model that encapsulates physical assumptions on the
                        external environment of the CPS application. In order to reason about the correctness of CPS applications, we
                        typically pose the following question: For all possible environment scenarios, does the closed-loop system
                        consisting of the plant and the controller exhibit the desired behavior? Typically, the desired behavior is
                        expressed in terms of properties that specify unsafe behaviors of the closed-loop system. Often, such behaviors are
                        expressed using variants of real-time temporal logics. In this chapter, we will examine formal methods based on
                        bounded-time reachability analysis, simulation-guided reachability analysis, deductive techniques based on safety
                        invariants, and formal, requirement-driven testing techniques. We will review key results in the literature, and
                        discuss the scalability and applicability of such systems to various academic and industrial contexts. We conclude
                        this chapter by discussing the challenge to formal verification and testing techniques posed by newer CPS
                        applications that use AI-based software components.

                                We consider the problem of monitoring temporal
                                patterns expressed in Signal Temporal Logic
                                (STL) over time-series data in a
                                <i>clairvoyant</i> fashion.  Existing offline
                                or online monitoring algorithms can only
                                compute the satisfaction of a given STL formula
                                on the time-series data that is available. We
                                use off-the-shelf statistical time-series
                                analysis techniques to fit available data to a
                                model and use this model to forecast future
                                signal values. We derive the joint probability
                                distribution of predicted signal values and use
                                this to compute the satisfaction probability of
                                a given signal pattern over the prediction
                                horizon. There are numerous potential
                                applications of such prescient detection of
                                temporal patterns. We demonstrate practicality

                                Given a black-box system with inputs and outputs, and a correctness
                                specification for the outputs, mines assumptions on the input
                                (i.e. the environment) for the corresponding outputs to satisfy the
                                given correctness spec. The input assumptions are assumed to be 
                                expressible in STL. The mining algorithm enumerates PSTL formulas
                                and uses decision trees on the space of robustness values induced
                                by STL formulas obtained by sampling the parameter space of the PSTL
                                formula. Learned decision tree is then converted into an STL formula
                                that constitutes the environment assumption. Uses falsification to
                                refine the environment assumption (eliminate inputs that do not 
                                satisfy the output requirements).

                                We formulate numerically-robust inductive proof rules for unbounded stability and safety
                                properties of continuous dynamical systems.  These induction rules robustify standard
                                notions of Lyapunov functions and barrier certificates so that they can tolerate small
                                numerical errors. In this way, numerically-driven decision procedures can

                                Convolutional Neural Networks have been proposed for identifying objects in 
                                images. In self-driving cars, these CNNs detect objects in frames of a video.
                                While CNNs like SqueezeDet and Yolo have shown a lot of promise at fast one-shot
                                object detection, they can make mistakes because they do not integrate temporal
                                information across frames. We formulate TQTL -- an extension to STL to reason
                                about sanity conditions that an object detector must satisfy while detecting
                                objects across multiple frames (e.g. persistence of labels for the same object,
                                constraints imposed by physical laws of motion, etc.). TQTL shows that both
                                SqueezeDet and Yolo can miss detecting objects, detect phantom objects, and 
                                change bounding boxes of the same object across frames in ways that can confuse
                                a downstream decision-making system. A cool feature of using TQTL is that you
                                do not need any ground truth labels! We may not be able to check if a hippopotamus
                                is indeed labeled a hippopotamus, but we will certaintly detect if the CNN
                                changes its label to velociraptor.

                                The use of neural networks for control has been on the rise, partly due to the successes
                                of deep reinforcement learning techniques. The question that we broach in this paper is
                                the following: is it possible to train the neural network controller in such a way that
                                the system always remains safe? We answer this question in the affirmative using the
                                formalism of control barrier functions.  A control barrier function guarantees that for
                                every state of the given control system, there exists a control input that keeps the
                                system safe.  That is, it guarantees that the system trajectories never leave a
                                designated safe set of states. In our setup, we assume that the user provides us a CBF,
                                and the neural network controller is trained to respect the CBF conditions. We check
                                the latter using the nonlinear SMT solver dReal. If dReal gives a counterexample, we
                                incorporate this counterexample in the cost function for training the network, which
                                guarantees that this counterexample (and hopefully a robust region around it) will
                                satisfy the CBF conditions. This yields a verification-in-the-loop reinforcement 
                                learning procedure that produces correct-by-construction neural network controllers.

                                Deep Reinforcement Learning uses custom-designed reward functions to help
                                pick the desired behavior of a closed-loop control system. User-created
                                state-based reward functions are susceptible to reward hacking, where the
                                agent learns an undesirable behavior because the user did not foresee how
                                the agent could maximize expected long term rewards through unexpected policies
                                that can be both undesirable and unsafe. The fix is reward shaping: careful
                                crafting of rewards; of course, this can be error prone as well. Our solution
                                is to express desired high-level behavior using the formalism of Signal Temporal
                                Logic (STL). We also formulate an algorithm to assign state-based rewards 
                                by computing the quantitative semantics of the given STL specification over 
                                a bounded horizon (similar to performing a rollout). Our algorithm shows 
                                that using STL-based rewards potentially allows deep RL to converge faster to
                                a safer policy.

                                Shape Expressions (SEs) are like regular expressions where atomic symbols 
                                specif shapes. While regexps are used for pattern matching in strings,
                                SEs are used for pattern matching in time-series data (i.e. signals). 
                                Basic shapes can include lines, polynomial curves, exponential curves, 
                                sinusoids, etc. The language of SEs includes unions and Kleene star in 
                                addition to basic shapes. While a signal can exactly match a SE, we
                                also allow noisy matches, i.e. where a signal segment may be at a bounded 
                                deviation from a constituent basic shape in the SE. We typically use
                                statistical measures such as mean squared error (MSE) for measuring
                                such deviations. Thus, a SE corresponds to both an exact language over
                                signals as well as a noisy language (for a given error threshold). In
                                this paper, we introduce SEs, and give an automata-based algorithm for
                                monitoring an SE.

                                This paper proposes using the idea of performing fault localization using statistical
                                techniques. In software testing, tools such as Tarantula and later extensions showed the
                                efficacy of basing fault localization on the correlation between accessing a program
                                location and the program run being faulty. We extend this observation to CPS, where
                                runs can be assessed quantitatively for their degree of satisfaction/violation. We also
                                focus on optimizing/analyzing model parameters. A common paradigm for storing model
                                parameters is in the form of look-up tables. We exploit the special metric structure
                                provided by the look-up table (assuming that the table represents a discretization of
                                some nonlinear function). We have implemented this idea in a Matlab extension called
                                Vajra that builds on top of the Breach toolbox. The tool also provides cool
                                visualizations of likely bug locations.

                                A key shortcoming of our CAV '17 paper on logical clustering is that the user needs to
                                provide a relative ordering between parameters of a given PSTL formula (that is used as
                                the logical lens for projecting time-series data to a learning-amenable space). Here, we
                                make the observation that for monotone logical properties, we can instead project a 
                                time-series datum to the (approximate) validity domain boundary of the given PSTL formula
                                and then perform clustering on this space. This allows us to effectively cluster and learn
                                some interesting new classes of STL-based classifiers.

                                In order to effectively analyze and build cyberphysical systems (CPS), designers today
                                have to combat the data deluge problem, i.e., the burden of processing intractably large
                                amounts of data produced by complex models and experiments. In this work, we utilize
                                monotonic parametric signal temporal logic (PSTL) to design features for unsupervised
                                classification of time series data. This enables using off-the-shelf machine learning
                                tools to automatically cluster similar traces with respect to a given PSTL formula. We
                                demonstrate how this technique produces interpretable formulas that are amenable to
                                analysis and understanding using a few representative examples. We illustrate this with
                                case studies related to automotive engine testing, highway traffic analysis, and
                                auto-grading massively open online courses.

                                We present a technique to investigate abnormal behaviors of signals in both time and
                                frequency domains using an extension of time-frequency logic that uses the continuous
                                wavelet transform. Abnormal signal behaviors such as unexpected oscillations, called
                                hunting behavior, can be challenging to capture in the time domain; however, these
                                behaviors can be naturally captured in the time-frequency domain. We introduce the
                                concept of parametric time-frequency logic and propose a parameter synthesis approach
                                that can be used to classify hunting behavior. We perform a comparative analysis between
                                the proposed algorithm, an approach based on support vector machines using linear
                                classification, and a method that infers a signal temporal logic formula as a data

                                Evaluation of industrial embedded control system designs is a
                                time-consuming and imperfect process. While an ideal process would
                                apply a formal verification technique such as model checking or theorem
                                proving, these techniques do not scale to industrial design problems,
                                and it is often difficult to use these techniques to verify performance
                                aspects of control system designs, such as stability or convergence.
                                For industrial designs, engineers rely on testing processes to identify
                                critical or unexpected behaviors. We propose a novel framework called
                                Underminer to improve the testing process; this is an automated
                                technique to identify non-converging behaviors in embedded control
                                system designs. Underminer treats the system as a black box, and lets
                                the designer indicate the model parameters, inputs and outputs that are
                                of interest. It supports a multiplicity of convergence-like notions,
                                such as those based on Lyapunov analysis and those based on temporal
                                logic formulae. Underminer can be applied in the context of testing
                                models created in the controller-design phase, and can also be applied
                                in a scenario such as hardware-in-the-loop testing. We demonstrate the
                                efficacy of Underminer by evaluating its performance on several
                                examples.

                                We study the problem of falsifying reachability properties of
                                real-time control software acting in a closed-loop with a given model
                                of the plant dynamics. Our approach employs numerical techniques to
                                simulate a plant model, which may be highly nonlinear and hybrid, in
                                combination with symbolic simulation of the controller software. The
                                state-space and input-space of the plant are systematically searched
                                using a plant abstraction that is implicitly defined by
                                ``quantization'' of the plant state, but never explicitly constructed.
                                Simultaneously, the controller behaviors are explored using a symbolic
                                execution of the control software. On-the-fly exploration of the
                                overall closed-loop abstraction results in abstract counterexamples,
                                which are used to refine the plant abstraction iteratively until a
                                concrete violation is found. Empirical evaluation of our approach
                                shows its promise in treating controller software that has precise,
                                formal semantics, using an exact method such as symbolic execution,
                                while using numerical simulations to produce abstractions of the
                                underlying plant model that is often an approximation of the actual
                                plant. We also discuss a preliminary comparison of our approach with
                                techniques that are primarily simulation-based.

                               Signal Temporal Logic allows specifying temporal properties 
                               of real-valued signals over dense time-domains. Alongwith the
                               usual Boolean semantics, it is also equipped with quantitative
                               semantics that allow estimating how robustly a given signal 
                               satisfies a given property. Offline algorithms to compute 
                               the robust satisfaction value require the entire signal over
                               a given finite time horizon to be available before computation
                               can proceed. Online algorithms can estimate upper and lower
                               bounds on the robust satisfaction value (called the robust
                               satisfaction interval RoSI) over prefixes of a complete signal,
                               updating the RoSI as more information about the signal becomes
                               available. In this paper, we propose memory-efficient algorithms
                               to monitor the RoSI in an online fashion.

                                The Skorokhod distance is a metric on functions (over time) that quantifies 
                                mismatches between signal values as well as time jitter. This metric has been
                                heretofore used to define topologies for hybrid systems, but Vinayak and Rupak
                                had a nice paper in HSCC 2015 to compute the Skorokhod distance for polygonal 
                                traces in polynomial time. We employ this a metric for testing conformance. 
                                First, we explore a restriction of the metric which restricts time jitter to 
                                a finite window -- this brings down the complexity to linear in the length of
                                the trace. Next, we explore an optimization-guided approach to find an input to
                                two dynamical systems that maximizes the Skorokhod distance between the
                                corresponding outputs. This corresponds to finding non-conformant behavior. 
                                Finally, we show that traces satisfying similar temporal logic properties 
                                are classified to be close by the Skorokhod metric; further establishing its
                                usefulness in quantifying system conformance.
                               <i> The FMSD paper is a more comprehensive version of this paper, comparing
                               Skorokhod distance computation between traces constructed using piecewise 
                               constant interpolation. Specifically, in the FMSD paper, we study the tradeoff 
                               between the runtime complexity of the distance computation (between piecewise 
                               linear traces and piecewise constant traces) and the higher sampling rate required
                               for piecewise constant traces.</i>

                                but the considerable complexity of these systems has made quality checking a challenging
                                endeavor. Simulation-based checking approaches are attractive, as they often scale well
                                with the complexity of the system design. This paper presents an overview of
                                simulation-guided techniques that can be used to increase the confidence in the quality
                                of an automotive powertrain control system design. We discuss the relationship between
                                simulation-based approaches and the broader areas of verification and powertrain control
                                design.  Also, we discuss new software tools that use simulation-guided approaches to
                                address various aspects of automotive powertrain control design verification. We

                                Falsification for CPS models is about finding input signals to the model that cause
                                the corresponding output signals to violate a specified Signal Temporal Logic (STL)
                                property. In falsification tools like S-TaLiRo and Breach, a strategy to finitize 
                                the search space, i.e. the infinite-dimensional input signal space, is to define a
                                finite parameterization of signals using control points.  In this paper, we explore
                                a strategy where we impose a discrete grid on the signal space, use Tabu search to
                                explore this grid, and random restarts to mitigate local optima. We also propose a
                                grid refinement strategy to lessen the user-burden of specifying the control points.

                                We present an approach for finding violations of safety properties of hybrid systems.
                                Existing approaches search for complete system trajectories that begin from an initial
                                state and reach some unsafe state. Our approach searches over sequences of trajectory
                                segments starting from any system states, where adjacent segments may have gaps; our
                                approach then seeks to narrow these gaps iteratively.  Interesting segmented
                                trajectories are discovered using a randomized scatter-and-simulate algorithm.

                                capturing the physical behavior of important subsystems in the engine and
                                a multi-mode controller representing different regimes of operation. The

                                The theory of regular functions provides a class of analyzable functions from
                                strings to numbers, that can provide a foundation for analyzing quantitative
                                properties of finite-state sysmtes.  Cost Register Automata (CRA) are deterministic
                                machines that map strings to costs using a vocabulary of interesting operations
                                such as adding, scaling, min. The notion of regularity provides a yardstick
                                to measure expressiveness, and to study decision problems and theoretical
                                properties of resulting classes of cost functions. Over suitably defined 
                                vocabularies, CRA generalize weighted automata and probabilistic
                                automata, and also allow us to express generalized min-cost problems over

                                We propose a new design methodology for communication protocols based on the
                                observation that protocols are usually understood in terms of abstract 
                                scenarios; each of which consists of a set of transition snippets. A 
                                transition snippet describes a single step of the concrete behavior of a
                                protocol, or a single symbolic execution step, or a mixture of both. Given
                                a protocol specified as snippets, we show how intelligent expression and 
                                synthesis coupled with an explicit-state model checker can be used in an
                                iterative manner to converge to a complete, fully symbolic protocol 
                                description. The advantage of doing things this way is twofold: (1) 
                                specifying a protocol as scenarios is more natural, and (2) our 
                                synthesis procedure provides a correct-by-construction protocol from
                                such a designer-friendly specification.

                                We present a notion of robustness for a networked system when the underlying 
                                network is prone to errors.  Networked system is modeled as Mealy machines  
                                communicating over a set of internal channels, and interacting with the 
                                outside world through a fixed set of input and output channels. We focus on 
                                network errors that arise from channel perturbations, and given a worst-case 
                                bound 'i' for the number of errors that can occur in the internal channels,
                                we estimate if the worst-case error in the output channel is less than a 
                                given bound 'o'. Such a network is called (i,o)-robust.  Error is measured
                                as distance from unperturbed output, and we give procedures polynomial in
                                the size of the network when the distance metric is the edit (Levenshtein) 
                                distance or the L1-norm.

                                NSSTs can realize MSO-definable relations between strings, and are closed under 
                                seq.  composition.  Functional NSSTs are nondeterministic, yet implement functions 
                                from strings to strings.  Checking functionality of an NSST is in PSPACE,  
                                equivalence checking for functional NSSTs is PSPACE-complete, while that for 
                                NSSTs is undecidable.  Checking containment of an NSST in a finite union of 
                                deterministic SSTs is in PSPACE. An NSST could be potentially used as a model
                                for concurrent methods acting on a singly-linked data structure.
