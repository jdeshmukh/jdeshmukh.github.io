    <h4>Course Description:</h4><br>
    <p>
    Cars, ground and aerial robots, and medical devices have all traditionally relied 
    on a human operator. By bestowing autonomy on these systems, we hope to replace
    the human operator or reduce their role by the use of intelligent software agents. 
    While classical software design typically involves reasoning about concerns only
    in the cyber-space, autonomous systems are usually cyber-physical systems, i.e. 
    they involve a set of physical components, e.g., mechanical, electrical or biological
    component being controlled and monitored by software.   
    </p>

    <p>
    This course introduces you to the design and analysis of such autonomous
    cyber-physical systems (ACPS) from a computer science and formal reasoning
    perspective. This includes: formal models of computation for ACPS,
    including models for the real world environments/components as well as
    models for the control software, formal languages for specification and
    testing of ACPS, and basics of linear and nonlinear control theory as used
    for ACPS.  In the second part of the course, we will study some of the main
    components used in autonomy such as software components for perception,
    planning, navigation, and AI-based techniques for control design such as
    reinforcement learning.  The homework assignments will be written
    exercises, while two mini-projects will require coding in Python as well as
    Matlab/Simulink. The mini-projects include an implementation of a simple
    self-driving vehicle subsystem, and an assignment about programming
    unmanned aerial vehicles (in the Matlab environment).  The course will
    position you to gain the skills required for industrial development of
    autonomous systems, and will also enable you to think about research
    problems in autonomy.
