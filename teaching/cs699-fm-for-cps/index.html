<h2>Course Description:</h2>
Modern automobiles, medical devices, avionics systems, complex robots, smart
energy and infrastructure systems are all examples of cyber-physical systems
(CPS). Such systems are characterized by two main aspects: (1) physical
components (e.g. electrical, electronic, mechanical, hydraulic mechanisms), and
(2) software that is used to control the behavior of the physical components.
Increasingly, such CPS applications are seeking to become autonomous with the
help of artificial intelligence components trained using machine learning
algorithms. In such a setting, an important question is how we reason about the
correctness, safety, reliability and security of such systems. In this seminar
course, we will explore the key literature in this area including the latest
research results.

<h2>Learning Objectives:</h2>
<ol>
<li> Gain basic familiarity with formal techniques for reasoning about correctness of CPS applications.</li>
<li> Understand verification approaches based on automatic techniques like model checking as well as less automated deductive methods. </li>
<li> Learn how system specifications are expressed using real-time temporal logics. </li>
<li> Learn about requirement-based testing approaches. </li>
<li> Learn about CPS applications that use AI-based components such as neural networks. </li>
<li> Learn how to critically read a technical research paper in this topic. </li>
</ol>
