<p>
From <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/engl/academic-conduct/">Dornsife's
academic conduct policy</a>: Plagiarism -- presenting someone else's ideas as
your own, either verbatim or recast in your own words -- is a serious academic
offense with serious consequences. Please familiarize yourself with the
discussion of plagiarism in SCampus in Part B, Section 11, <a
href="https://policy.usc.edu/scampus-part-b/">&ldquo; Behavior Violating
University Standards.&rdquo;</a> Other forms of academic dishonesty are equally
unacceptable. See additional information in SCampus and university policies on
scientific misconduct, <a
href="http://policy.usc.edu/scientific-misconduct">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Discrimination, sexual assault, intimate partner violence, stalking, and
harassment are prohibited by the university. You are encouraged to report all
incidents to the Office of Equity and Diversity/Title IX Office <a
href="http://equity.usc.edu">here</a>, and/or to the <a
href="http://dps.usc.edu">Department of Public Safety</a>. This is important
for the health and safety of the whole USC community. Faculty and staff must
report any information regarding an incident to the Title IX Coordinator who
will provide outreach and information to the affected party. The sexual assault
resource center <a href="http://sarc.usc.edu">webpage</a> fully describes
reporting options. Relationship and Sexual Violence Services <a
href="https://engemannshc.usc.edu/rsvp">webpage</a> provides 24/7 confidential
support.
</p>

<p>
Note on collaborative work:
For collaborative projects, students are expected to have equal distribution of
work. If there is any perceived imbalance in the collaborative project, the
student should bring this to the attention of the instructor or the teaching
assistant.
</p>

<p> 
Assistance with writing and disabilities:
Several USC's schools provide support for students who need help with scholarly
writing. Check with your advisor or program staff to find out more.  Students
whose primary language is not English should check with the <a
href="http://ali.usc.edu">American Language Institute</a> which sponsors
courses and workshops specifically for international graduate students. The <a
href="http://dsp.usc.edu">Office of Disability Services and Programs</a>
provides certification for students with disabilities and helps arrange the
relevant accommodations. If an officially declared emergency makes travel to
campus infeasible, <a href="http://emergency.usc.edu">USC Emergency
Information</a> will provide safety and other updates, including ways in which
instruction will be continued by means of Blackboard, teleconferencing, and
other technology.
